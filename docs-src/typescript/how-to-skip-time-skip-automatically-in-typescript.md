The test server starts in "normal" time. When you use `TestWorkflowEnvironment.workflowClient.execute()` or `.result()`, the test server is switched to "skipped" time mode until the Workflow completes. In "skipped" mode, timers (`sleep()`s and `condition()` timeouts) are fast-forwarded except when Activities are running.

`workflows.ts`

```ts
import {sleep} from "@temporalio/workflow";

export async function sleeperWorkflow() {
  await sleep("1 day");
}
```

`test.ts`

```ts
import {sleeperWorkflow} from "./workflows";

test("sleep completes almost immediately", async () => {
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    connection: testEnv.nativeConnection,
    taskQueue: "test",
    workflowsPath: require.resolve("./workflows"),
  });
  // Does not wait an entire day
  await worker.runUntil(
    testEnv.workflowClient.execute(sleeperWorkflow, {
      workflowId: uuid(),
      taskQueue: "test",
    })
  );
});
```
